# Community Code of Conduct

We believe that a friendly environment is the best way to get better ideas, better discussions and, in the end, a better prduct. Let's make this easy for everybody in our community.


## Scope
We expect all members of the cKret community, including paid and unpaid agents, administrators, users, and customers of cKret, to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all cKret community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to cKret affairs.

This policy covers the usage of the cKret registry, as well as the cKret website, cKret related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf of cKret (collectively, the "Service"). It also applies to behavior in the context of the cKret Open Source project communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, IRC channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of the Service.

Abusive behavior may result on banning from the community.
